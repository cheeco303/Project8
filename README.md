Insurance Price Prediction


Dataset Overview:
The dataset contains various details about individuals, including age, gender, BMI, number of
children, smoking habits, region, medical and family medical history, exercise frequency, occupation,
coverage level, and their corresponding insurance charges.
Tasks:
• Visualize Insurance Charges Distribution:
Create a visualization that shows the distribution of insurance charges across different individuals.
Highlight the average insurance charges based on age, gender, and region.
• Analyze Health and Lifestyle Impact:
Visualize the relationship between BMI, smoking habits, and insurance charges.
Create a chart to show how medical history (e.g., diabetes, high blood pressure) impacts insurance
premiums.
• Study the Role of Occupation and Coverage Level:
Compare insurance charges across different occupations (e.g., blue collar, white collar).
Analyze how different coverage levels (e.g., standard, premium) affect the insurance charges.
• Examine Family and Exercise Factors:
Create visualizations that show the influence of family medical history and exercise frequency on
insurance charges.
Identify any patterns indicating that certain exercise habits or family health history affect insurance
costs.
Conclusions and Insights:
Based on your visualizations, identify key factors that contribute to higher or lower insurance
charges.
Provide recommendations for how individuals might lower their insurance costs based on their
lifestyle and medical history.
Deliverables:
A Power BI dashboard with all the required visualizations.
A brief report summarizing your findings and explaining the insights gained from the dashboard.
